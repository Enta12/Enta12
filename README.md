## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm a 26-year-old web developer with a Master's degree from Epitech.  
During my years there, I built strong problem-solving skills and learned to thrive in team environments.

I honed my technical expertise at **SogetiLabs (Capgemini)**, focusing on **ReactJS**, clean code practices, and Agile methodologies (Scrum).  
Working on client hackathons taught me how to deliver fast and iterate quickly under tight deadlines.

After graduation, I took the entrepreneurial leap. Through France’s #EntrepreneurLeader program, I founded **The Dice Guild** — a community-driven progressive web app for tabletop RPG players.  
For two years, I led the entire product lifecycle: user research, feature planning, UX/UI design, and full-stack development.  
I also managed technical decisions with budget and time constraints in mind, ensuring the app’s long-term viability.

In parallel, I’ve also had the opportunity to **teach web development to Bachelor-level students (Bac+3)**, helping them understand core concepts in frontend/backend technologies, project structure, and best coding practices — an experience that deepened my own skills and communication abilities.

Today, I’m looking for my next challenge: somewhere I can **build great products and grow alongside a passionate team**.
